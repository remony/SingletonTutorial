<h1>Where should we use Singletons <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up makeGreen"></i></h1>
<P>
    You use Singletons when you have a class which you want to be accessed globally. One way to implement a singleton is to lazy load it. Singletons are lazy loaded only when they are required which can be useful when handling heavy load like database connections or multiplayer connections.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead of lazy utilizing a singleton we use singletons to avoid creating multiple instances of a class ensuring that there is only one until the application/game is closed. Another example of a singleton are persistent singletons where in unity you would use this to have a singleton to last between scenes for example you would use this if you wanted a song to continue playing as you switched between two scenes.
    <br><br>
    Both of these solutions bring issues such as concurrency related issues with lazy loading and global state issues with the singleton.
<br>
    Example Uses cases where you can use singletons are:

<ul>
    <li>As a logger</li>
    <li>Audio manager</li>
    <li>Texture manager</li>
</ul>
