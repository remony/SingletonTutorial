<h1>The Singleton Pattern</h1>




<blockquote>
    <p>The Sun, you see it everyday, and its always the same no matter where in the world you are until the night sky appears.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Singleton pattern is a commonly design pattern where you have a single instance of a class with global access to its resources. For example in a game you would implement a singleton to provide a global access to to a games core functions or managers such as music which would play between scenes or writing logs on the console but you also want to send them to a server.</p>

<p>The singleton ensures that throughout the life cycle of that application/game there will only be one instance of that class until the application or game has ended.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Ensure a class has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun is a great example of a singleton as there is only one instance of the sun, and all the planets can access the suns variables for example light and heat.</p>
