<h1 id="toc_10">Where should we not use Singletons?</h1>

<h3 id="toc_11">Nowhere?</h3>

<p>Many people will tell you to <strong>never use Singletons</strong>. They are bad, they say. They increase coupling, dependencies, make it difficult to test, they say. They have problems with multi-threading, they say.</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">Somewhere?</h3>

<p>Sometimes, you will need to provide global access to a class, such as in games development, where you may have a global <code>World</code> or <code>Game</code> object. Sometimes you may have a global <code>FileSystem</code>, <code>AudioEngine</code>, <code>PhysicsEngine</code>, or other. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of these examples, and, why in some instances, although you may think using a Singleton is the best idea, it can sometimes really not be.</p>


<h3 id="toc_14">A, B, and C, or friends and secrets</h3>

<p>Lets say you have classes <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, which are completely unrelated. You also have a global Singleton called <code>C</code>.</p>

<p>Upon reading the code, a developer may think that <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are unrelated (which they seem to be), but if they both use <code>C</code>, and the global state of <code>C</code> affects <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, then they really are related by the functionality and state provided by <code>C</code>.</p>

<p>This is an increase in coupling caused by a Singleton, which can make code not perform as you expect, and also introduce increased and unexpected complexity.</p>

<p>Or, as <em>Miško Hevery</em> puts it<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Think of it another way. You can live in a society where everyone (every class) declares who their friends (collaborators) are. If I know that Joe knows Mary but neither Mary nor Joe knows Tim, then it is safe for me to assume that if I give some information to Joe he may give it to Mary, but under no circumstances will Tim get hold of it. Now, imagine that everyone (every class) declares some of their friends (collaborators), but other friends (collaborators which are singletons) are kept secret. Now you are left wondering how in the world did Tim got hold of the information you gave to Joe.</p>

<h3 id="toc_15">Printers and ConnectionPools</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our program will only have a pool of connections for a printer, so that we cannot overload the printer with too many requests. A Singleton will be used for this connection pool, since it will be consistent across the whole program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although a good idea, it seems unnecessarily limiting. If throughout all your program you can see code like this:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-java">public class Payroll {
    ...
    public void print() {
    PrinterConnectionPool printer = PrinterConnectionPool.getInstance();
    printers.print(this.toPDF());
    }
    ...
    }</code></pre>

<p>What will happen when you add multiple printers? What if the user has more than one printer, or if their printer supports a connection pool of 10, 100, or 500 connections?</p>

<p>Is it really necessary to have a Singleton to manage these connections? Can you do dependency injection, by passing it as a parameter or using something like <strong><code>Guice</code></strong>?</p>

<p>In fact, what if the <code>print()</code> method above also did this, via another Singleton called <code>BankAccount</code>?</p>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-java">public class Payroll {
    ...
    public void print() {
    BankAccount.payEmployee(this.employee, this.amount);
    PrinterConnectionPool printer = PrinterConnectionPool.getInstance();
    printers.print(this.toPDF());
    }
    ...
    }</code></pre>

<p>This now means you cannot print a payroll without paying an Employee! All of that because it was too easy to use the Singleton <code>BankAccount</code> to make the payments automatic upon printing&hellip;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d have to assume code authors would never do something like that, but people make mistakes. Singletons can aid in these mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="toc_16">Testing</h3>

<p>As Brian Button says<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Persistent state is the enemy of unit testing. One of the things that makes unit testing effective is that each test has to be independent of all the others.</p>

    <p>If this is not true, then the order in which the tests run affects the outcome of the tests. This can lead to cases where tests fail when they shouldn&rsquo;t, and even worse, it can lead to tests that pass just because of the order in which they were run.</p>

    <p>This can hide bugs and is evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="toc_17">Web Service and global state</h3>

<p>Mugunth Kumar<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> gives us an example of an abuse case for a Singleton. I hope nobody does this, but it&rsquo;s good to know that it is a really, really bad idea:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Let me give you an example. When you develop an app that talks to a web service, the only “state” variable I could think of is your access token.</p>

    <p>Using a Singleton to encapsulate calls to web service that remembers the access token is fine. But if you store the response strings from one method and use it in another method and then release it in yet another method, you are doing it wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this instance, using a Singleton could make your program a lot shorter, because you only have to execute a web request, and write the response to the singleton.</p>

<p>However, as soon as a user does more than one request, you&rsquo;ll need to know which request was last executed. If you want to test a given request, you&rsquo;ll need to place data in the Singleton. Now all of your unit tests will depend on executing another request first to place data in the global singleton, and thus your tests are no longer independent.</p>
