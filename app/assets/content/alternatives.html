<h2>
    The Unity Alternative
</h2>

<p>
    As addressed on the Unity3D wiki, Singletons are generally abused by being misused a lot, so they encourage that you use ToolBox instead.

<h2>
    Toolbox
</h2>

<p>
    The Toolbox is a Singleton but improves on the concept by improving unit testing and coupling. What makes the Toolbox different from the Singleton is that a Singleton is a class where as the Toolbox is the application which contains the components required. You can learn more about the Toolbox in this paper www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/co-single/co-single-pdf.pdf.

Tool boxes make it easier for unit testing.
